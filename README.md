# Hi, I'm Pascal — Architect of Experience

I'm a full-stack developer, UI designer, and system troubleshooter based in Kenya. I specialize in building digital systems that blend backend logic, premium UI, and cultural relevance. Whether it's reviving bricked devices, designing emotionally resonant interfaces, or architecting community platforms, I bring persistence, empathy, and precision to every project.

Currently in my final semester of ICT studies, preparing for attachment in January 2026. This portfolio showcases the work I've done so far — from Laravel-powered web apps to hardware recovery and community-driven tools.
